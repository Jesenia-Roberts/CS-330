I approach designing software by planning, creating, and testing it incrementally. I assure each individual element/method works before moving on to the next, and by doing this I can pinpoint problems. The milestones helped with this significantly as, with the milestone system, there is no room for procrastination. It would be easy to leave a large project until the last few days and attempting to cram all the learned techniques into it with little time, but by doing the milestones you are able to gradually practice the techniques that you are learning throughout the course. I have a curiousity in game development, and I imagine that taking this graphics class may help deepen my understanding of engine programming.
